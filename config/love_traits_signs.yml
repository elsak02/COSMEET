love_traits_signs:
  Aries:
    'Like their ruling planet Mars, Aries are hot and stormy. They're a combination of confidence and passion combined with temper and petulance. Everyone who ever loves an Aries tries—unsuccessfully but excitingly—to tame them.'
  Taurus:
   'Ruled by Venus, Taureans are sensual to the max and very connected to their physical bodies. A Taurus must feel physical attraction from the start if a romance is going to take off. But those who want to seduce Taurus first have to get past the formidable external barriers this sign places in front of them.'
  Gemini:
    'Dynamic, intense, and with so many shifting parts to their personalities, Gemini love to date. Indeed, they consider dating a skill. Gemini are great at drawing first dates out of their shells, and they rarely have a "bad" date—because this optimism-infused sign will always finds something positive about the person they meet or the conversation they shared.'
  Cancer:
    'Sensual, passionate, and super in tune with their bodies, Cancers are highly attuned to love and physical sensation—as long as they can trust enough to let down their barriers and allow another person into their world.'
  Leo:
    'Passionate, intense, and fiery, Leo loves hard. For Leos, love itself—whether falling in love, thinking about love, making love—is one of their favorite things in the world. A busy Lion will always make sure that there's plenty of time for passion in his or her life.'
  Virgo:
    'Virgo loves hard, and is always in pursuit of star love the kind where souls, minds, and bodies seamlessly merge. That's why this sign sometimes gets the (unfair) reputation of being too picky.'
  Libra:
    'Libra adores flirting, loves the drama and pageantry of romance, and is one of the few signs of the Zodiac that actually enjoys first dates. While Libras excel at charming potential partners, they have difficulty figuring out what they want, and all too often can get lost in the twists and turns of a relationship.'
  Scorpio:
    'Rules by fiery Mars and destructive Pluto, Scorpio has one mode for relationships and that's full-on. Scorpio loves romance and passion, including up-all-night fights. Scorpio never does anything halfway, and believes that true love comes with true fights.'
  Sagittarius:
    'Ruled by expansive Jupiter, Sagittarius is big-hearted, open, and always looking beyond a checklist. A Sagittarius rarely has a “type,”— they are always intrigued by the individual, and don’t make any assumptions about people until they’ve truly met and spoken with them.'
  Capricorn:
    'Ruled by strict Saturn, Capricorn knows, expects, and even relishes the tough parts of relationships. They are in it for the long haul, and know the best relationships have storms. It’s not as if they are fatalistic—but Capricorns are realistic and aren’t going to have a rosy view of romance.'
  Aquarius:
    'When it comes to love, Aquarius may march to the beat of their own drummer—the free-love era wasn't named "The Age of Aquarius" for nothing. Aquarius doesn't take a lot of stock in what "should" be done, but Aquarius has their own rules, codes of ethics, and morality and takes all three incredibly seriously.'
  Pisces:
    'Passionate, intense, and singular, a relationship with a Pisces is a roller-coaster ride that will make you feel your feelings—even the bad ones—and help you emerge as a better, more honest person. Even if a relationship with a Pisces doesn't last, the lessons you learn from a Pisces partner will.'
